Note: contents are under construction. Will be updated soon.

This repository contains
```
├─ code                 # Matlab & R code to run the analyses and produce figures
├─ data                 # behavioral & fMRI data
```

**Note**: to reproduced the Matlab figures, you may need the [color brewer](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/34087-cbrewer-colorbrewer-schemes-for-matlab) toolbox and the [offsetAxes](https://github.com/anne-urai/Tools/blob/master/plotting/offsetAxes.m) function.
